# TableLayout Licensing

This is a bit of a mystery, or at least hard to establish a clear paper trail.

The version of the TableLayout library in `tablelayout.jar` here in `unknown-R2020a-version/`is the one redistributed with Matlab R2020a (and older versions). This one did not come with licensing info associated with it or embedded in the JAR. And it's just a binary distribution.

The `version-still-on-website/` one was downloaded from <http://www.clearthought.info/sun/products/jfc/tsc/articles/tablelayout/> on 2020-04-23.

The `version-on-oracle-dot-com/` one was downloaded from <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/tablelayout-141489.html> on 2020-04-23.

However, on 2020-04-23, I was able to find a newer version of TableLayout redistributed with the WebLaF library at <https://github.com/mgarin/weblaf/blob/4faefd1aae173c02dd534e4b708cc0408f4a3667/modules/ui/src/com/alee/extended/layout/TableLayout.java>, and this one contained the Clearthought Software License both embedded in the source files and included with the WebLaF distribution. I believe the same license applies to the older TableLayout release as well.

I've asked for additional provenance info, maybe they can help: <https://github.com/mgarin/weblaf/issues/615>. I've been unable to find contact info for Daniel Barbalace (TableLayout's author), and most of the <www.clearthought.info> website has fallen off the web.

Via Google, I was able to find an old scguild.com page for a Daniel Barbalace (<https://scguild.com/Resume/10276R.html>), but the email listed there (transient600@yahoo.com) bounces as of 2020-04-23.
